# Reducio

Are you tired of sharing long? Our link shortener is here to help. With just a few clicks, you can easily turn those long, unwieldy links into shorter, more manageable ones that are easier to share and remember.

But that's not all. We offer a storage feature that allows you to save your shortened links for future use. This way, you can keep all of your important links organized and easily accessible whenever you need them.
In addition we also offer the option to customize the name of your shortened links, also known as slugs. This allows you to choose a memorable and relevant name for your shortened link, making it even easier for you and your audience to remember and share.
